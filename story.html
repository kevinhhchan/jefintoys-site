          <h2>The Melissa & Doug Mission</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="storyblurb2">
      <h3>To ignite imagination and a sense of wonder in all children so they can discover themselves, their passions, and their purpose</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="storytext">
      <p>
        There was a time when childhood offered the space and freedom for children to explore their world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>To be curious. To be creative. To be bold. To be bored. To just... be.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, our children use their imaginations less than ever. That's why Melissa & Doug are committed to making products that inspire open-ended thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s part of their bigger vision to Take Back Childhood. Because by giving children a true childhood, we give them a path to realizing their full potential!

      <h2>Yes, Melissa and Doug Are Real People!</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="storyblurb2">
      <h3>It's usually the first question people ask, "Are Melissa and Doug REAL PEOPLE?" And when they meet them, the reaction is almost always the same--- sheer excitement to meet Melissa, and, ummmm, when they meet Doug, people usually wonder, does this guy EVER stop talking?!</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="storytext">
      <p>
        After pooling their life savings together, Melissa and Doug worked night and day out of Doug's parents' garage to develop their first product. To this day, they hand-make each prototype until they get it just right.
      </p>
      <p>
        They've also raised a family of six kids! Or, as Melissa likes to say, she has a total of <strong>SEVEN</strong> kids, if you include Doug, the most mischievous child of all!

        The best playthings are often simple concepts that inspire children to come up with their own ideas.

      <h3>Let's work together to let kids be kids.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="storytext">
      <p>
        <strong>Here are some ideas to get started:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Plan For Play</strong><br />
        Put free time on your calendar just like you’d pencil in games or music practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Let Kids Lead</strong><br />
        As parents, your role is to guide and facilitate, not direct or dictate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Keep It Free!</strong><br />
        The best play, discovery, and creation truly begins with nothing but imagination.
