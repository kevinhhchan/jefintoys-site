    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <h3>To ignite imagination and a sense of wonder in all children so they can discover themselves, their passions, and their purpose</h3>
    <p>
      There was a time not so long ago when childhood offered the space and freedom for children to explore their world. <strong>To be curious. To be creative. To be bold. To be bored. To just... be.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, our overscheduled and overstimulated children are using their imaginations less than ever. That's why we’re committed to making products that inspire open-ended thinking and encourage kids to see new possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s part of our bigger vision to Take Back Childhood. Because by giving children a true childhood, we give them a path to realizing their full potential!

    <h2>Yes, Melissa and Doug Are Actually Real People!</h2>
    <h3>It's usually the first question people ask, "Are Melissa and Doug REAL PEOPLE?" And when they meet them, the reaction is almost always the same- sheer excitement to meet Melissa, and, ummmm, when they meet Doug, people usually wonder, does this guy EVER stop talking?!</h3>
    <p>
      After pooling their life savings together, Melissa and Doug worked night and day out of Doug's parents' garage to develop their first product. To this day, they hand-make each prototype until they get it just right.
    </p>
    <p>
      They've also raised a family of six kids! Or, as Melissa likes to say, she has a total of SEVEN kids, if you include Doug, the most mischievous child of all!

    <h2>What We Create</h2>
    <h3>We make toys, games and many other products that offer children Countless Ways To Play</h3>
    <p>
      We believe the best playthings are often simple concepts that inspire children to come up with their own ideas and ways to play. With everything we create, we hope to encourage:
    </p>
    <p>
      Free Play<br />
      Creativity<br />
      Imagination<br />
      Learning<br />
      Discovery<br />

    <h2>Join Us!</h2>
    <h3>Let's work together to let kids be kids.</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Here are some ideas to get started:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Plan For Play</strong><br />
      Put free time on your calendar just like you’d pencil in games or music practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Let Kids Lead</strong><br />
      As parents, your role is to guide and facilitate, not direct or dictate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Keep It Free!</strong><br />
      The best play, discovery, and creation truly begins with nothing but imagination.
